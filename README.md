# Layout

The layout would include the following:

-title with the Dark Mode button on the bar
-On the side, it'll have the currency along with the city selected
-On the right, will have 2 divs:
    -Weather Report for the week
    -City information below

The idea behind is so it isn't too complicated for the user to be able to browse through and select the information on the city while also displaying on the needed information on what they are looking for.  Viewing it in the full window will have the borders along each div to represent a separate window from one another.  When the program is implemented for different sizes, the windows would stack with one another to make it a bit user friendly.

Something about the layout:  Originally, we're going to have the user start with the light mode, so the colors would be bright for the users to see.  The implementation of the dark mode is just in case the user prefers a more darker color to ease the eye tension.

All the interaction would initially start with selecting the city.  Once it has been called, the rest of the information would then be displayed in accordance to the window.


# Dark Mode 

Allows the user to view their content with a predominantly dark theme, compared to the typical white background we find on most websites and apps. So what is the purpose of this change? UX research shows that dark backgrounds enhance page contrast, making visuals pop and easier for the user to focus on. It's ideal for making visual applications and websites stand out. The deep, heavy backgrounds provide a perfect high-contrast backdrop for images, graphics, videos, and visuals of any shape and color. It's also perfect for distinct CVIs or attractive product imagery.

Two key end-user  benefits stand out when considering dark mode for our site:

1. The highly convincing argument that it may be easier on the eyes. This is pretty self-explanatory. Users are becoming more aware of daily screen time and actively seeking out ways to maintain a healthy balance with technology. For instance, Apple recently released Screen Time, allowing users to track the amount of time spent on their devices. Though it is not the responsibility of web designers and developers to look out for users’ natural light-dark cycles and circadian rhythms, it serves as an added bonus to offer your site visitors a dark mode option. Think of it this way: the easier on the eyes, the longer your visitors will stay on the site. 

2. It can improve device battery life. That’s right—some developers claim that dark mode consumes only a fraction of the percentage that using a site or application takes from your battery, saving your users time between charges.

With the rise of digital personalization and online interactions, it’s important that our users feel our brand has their best interest in mind. Especially when attracting new users, these subtle enhancements to their experience can make all the difference. 

# UI for Mobile Devices

Mobile versions of websites are pervasive and practically essential these days. After all: one design for the Android, another for the iPhone, the iPad, netbook, Kindle — and all screen resolutions must be compatible, too. In the next five years, we’ll likely need to design for a number of additional inventions. When will the madness stop?  It won’t, of course.

By utilizing an alternative CSS Framework (Bulma); the website displays accordingly to accommodate all devices and screen sizes by automatically adapting to the screen, whether it's a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or even a smart TV and it responds to the user's behavior based on screen size, platform and orientation.
